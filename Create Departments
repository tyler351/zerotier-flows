# Create a tag for which department someone is in
tag department
  id 1000                 # arbitrary, but must be unique
  enum 100 sales          # has no meaning to filter, but used in UI to offer a selection
  enum 200 engineering
  enum 300 support
  enum 400 manufacturing
;


### Example filter
# Allow Windows CIFS and netbios between computers in the same department using a tag
accept
  ipprotocol tcp
  and tdiff department 0  # difference between department tags is 0, meaning they match
